# Pynenka

Pynenka is a simple low level twitter bot that replies with the football score of the closest/current football game to the time. 

The live scores are scraped from [livescores.com](https://www.livescores.com/).

The twitter app keys are removed due to security reasons.

## How does it work
To test pynenka simply open twitter and [@pynenka](https://twitter.com/pynenka) followed by the hashtag #Golazo and never miss out on any moment!
Currently, I am not hosting the program anywhere and hence won't work unless manually run. Check the demo below to see how Pynenka works!

### Demo

### TODO
1. Add Goalscorers and minutes and make it more responsive.
2. Like and Comment on selected #Football posts
3. Return live score of requested games
4. Follow the mentions if not already
